in python3:
	- for each simulation find the wait and turn around times
	- parse the times with re
	- calculate the average wait and turn around times
	- format the data and save it in wait and turn around .csv's

with gnuplot in bash:
	- plot wait and turn around time based on data created in python
	- save the plots as .pdf's
